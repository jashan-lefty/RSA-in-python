Here's a mathematical explanation of RSA that you can include in your `README.md` file on GitHub for your Python code.

# RSA Algorithm - Mathematical Explanation

The **Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)** algorithm is a widely used public-key cryptographic system that enables secure data transmission. It is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

## **Key Generation (Public and Private Keys)**

1. **Choose two large prime numbers**  
   \( p \) and \( q \).

2. **Compute their product (Modulus)**  
   \[
   n = p \times q
   \]  
   The modulus \( n \) is used in both the public and private keys.

3. **Calculate Eulerâ€™s Totient Function**  
   \[
   \phi(n) = (p - 1) \times (q - 1)
   \]  
   where \( \phi(n) \) represents the count of integers less than \( n \) that are coprime to \( n \).

4. **Choose a public exponent \( e \)**  
   The public exponent \( e \) should satisfy:  
   - \( 1 < e < \phi(n) \)  
   - \( \gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \) (i.e., \( e \) is coprime to \( \phi(n) \))  

   A common choice for \( e \) is **65537** because it offers a good balance between security and efficiency.

5. **Compute the private exponent \( d \)**  
   The private exponent \( d \) is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \( e \) modulo \( \phi(n) \):  
   \[
   d \equiv e^{-1} \mod \phi(n)
   \]  
   This means \( d \) is the number that satisfies:  
   \[
   (d \times e) \mod \phi(n) = 1
   \]  

6. **Public and Private Key Pairs:**  
   - **Public Key**: \( (e, n) \)  
   - **Private Key**: \( (d, n) \)

## **Encryption Process**
To encrypt a message \( M \):

1. Convert the message into an integer representation \( M \) (e.g., ASCII encoding).
2. Compute the ciphertext \( C \) using modular exponentiation:  
   \[
   C = M^e \mod n
   \]  
3. Transmit \( C \) securely.

---

## **Decryption Process**
To decrypt the ciphertext \( C \):

1. Compute the original message \( M \) using the private key \( d \):  
   \[
   M = C^d \mod n
   \]  
2. Convert \( M \) back to the original plaintext format.

---

## **Why RSA is Secure?**
1. **Factoring \( n = p \times q \) is hard**  
   The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of **factoring large composite numbers**. If an attacker cannot factor \( n \) into \( p \) and \( q \), they cannot compute \( \phi(n) \) or derive \( d \).

2. **Modular exponentiation is a one-way function**  
   Given \( M \), computing \( C \) is easy, but retrieving \( M \) from \( C \) without knowing \( d \) is computationally infeasible.

---

## **Example with Small Numbers**
1. Choose two prime numbers:  
   \( p = 61, q = 53 \)  
   \( n = 61 \times 53 = 3233 \)  
   \( \phi(n) = (61-1) \times (53-1) = 3120 \)  

2. Choose \( e = 17 \) (since \( \gcd(17, 3120) = 1 \))  
   Compute \( d \):  
   \( d \equiv 17^{-1} \mod 3120 = 2753 \)  

3. Encrypt \( M = 65 \):  
   \[
   C = 65^{17} \mod 3233 = 2790
   \]  

4. Decrypt \( C = 2790 \):  
   \[
   M = 2790^{2753} \mod 3233 = 65
   \]
